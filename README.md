# Mixlib::Log

[![Build Status Master](https://travis-ci.org/chef/mixlib-log.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef/mixlib-log) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/mixlib-log.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/mixlib-log)

Mixlib::Log provides a mixin for enabling a class based logger object, a-la Merb, Chef, and Nanite. To use it:

```ruby
require 'mixlib/log'

class Log
  extend Mixlib::Log
end
```

You can then do:

```ruby
Log.debug('foo')
Log.info('bar')
Log.warn('baz')
Log.error('baz')
Log.fatal('wewt')
```

By default, `Mixlib::Logger` logs to STDOUT. To alter this, you should call `Log.init`, passing any arguments to the standard Ruby Logger. For example:

```ruby
Log.init('/tmp/logfile')  # log to /tmp/logfile   
Log.init('/tmp/logfile', 7)  # log to /tmp/logfile, rotate every day
```

Enjoy!
